# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your App is Now Ready for Deployment!

Your event tracker has been successfully migrated from JSON files to PostgreSQL and is ready for production deployment.

## 📋 What We Changed

### ✅ Backend Migration
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Integration**: Replaced JSON files with PostgreSQL database
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Added support for production configuration
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Created `events` and `attendees` tables
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for database operations
- ✅ **Production Scripts**: Added build and production start commands

### ✅ Frontend Updates
- ✅ **Dynamic API URLs**: Frontend now detects production vs development
- ✅ **Environment Support**: Reads `REACT_APP_API_URL` for production
- ✅ **Build Ready**: Frontend can be built for production deployment

## 🔧 Deploy to Railway (Recommended)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository
```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate to PostgreSQL for production deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. **Go to**: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Sign up**: Use your GitHub account
3. **New Project**: Click "New Project"
4. **Deploy from GitHub**: Select your repository
5. **Add PostgreSQL**: Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
6. **Connect Variables**: Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Railway will automatically set:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT` - Application port
- `NODE_ENV=production` - Production mode

### Step 4: Build Configuration
Railway will automatically:
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Start your app with `npm start`
- Expose your app on a public URL

## 🎯 Testing Before Deployment

### Test with Local PostgreSQL (Optional)
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL locally (macOS)
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Create database
createdb eventtracker

# Test your app
npm start
```

### Test with Current Setup
Your app will fallback to SQLite in development if PostgreSQL isn't available.

## 🌐 Production URLs

After deployment, Railway will give you:
- **Backend**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- **API**: `https://your-app-name.railway.app/api`

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 2: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)
1. Deploy backend to Railway
2. Deploy frontend to Vercel
3. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in Vercel to your Railway backend URL

### Option 3: Netlify (Frontend) + Railway (Backend)
1. Deploy backend to Railway
2. Deploy frontend to Netlify
3. Set environment variable in Netlify

## 📱 Post-Deployment Testing

Test these features after deployment:
- ✅ **Create Events**: Admin login and event creation
- ✅ **Join Events**: Guest registration with phone validation
- ✅ **Live Updates**: Real-time attendee synchronization
- ✅ **Capacity Limits**: Attendee limit enforcement
- ✅ **Data Persistence**: Events persist between restarts

## 🎉 Your App Features (Production Ready)

- ✅ **Real-time Synchronization**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Database**: Scalable, reliable data storage
- ✅ **Role-based Access**: Admin vs guest permissions
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Works on all devices
